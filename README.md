# FateArcanaAI

A project that explores the intersection of Fate/Grand Order, tarot divination, and artificial intelligence. The goal is to create an AI that can perform tarot readings tailored to the lore and characters of Fate/Grand Order, providing unique insights and interpretations.

## Key Features

*   **User Context:** The system elicits information about the user's current situation, emotional state, and relevant personal history through a series of guided questions. This information is then used to subtly influence the interpretation of the tarot cards, ensuring the reading resonates with the user's specific circumstances. For example, a user expressing feelings of anxiety might receive a reading that emphasizes the need for patience and self-care, even if the cards themselves don't explicitly suggest those themes.
*   **Querents:** Users can choose a "querent," a character from Fate/Grand Order whose personality and experiences will be used to frame the tarot reading. This involves adapting the language, tone, and focus of the interpretation to align with the chosen character. For instance, a reading for a user who selects Gilgamesh as their querent will be delivered with his characteristic arrogance and focus on power dynamics, while a reading with Mash Kyrielight as the querent will be more empathetic and focused on protection and support. This feature aims to create a more immersive and engaging experience for fans of Fate/Grand Order.

## Philosophy and Intuition

FateArcanaAI incorporates elements of Kantian philosophy, particularly the emphasis on the role of intuition in understanding the world. While the AI uses data and algorithms to analyze tarot readings, it also leverages a degree of "intuition" – simulated through sophisticated AI techniques – to interpret the cards in a nuanced and context-aware manner. This allows the system to move beyond simple keyword interpretations and provide readings that resonate with the user's individual circumstances and the chosen querent's perspective.

## Technology Stack

FateArcanaAI is built using Ruby on Rails, a powerful and flexible web application framework. This choice allows for rapid development, maintainability, and scalability.

## Synthetic Voice Output

To enhance the immersive experience, FateArcanaAI utilizes a synthetic voice to deliver the tarot readings. The system employs a text-to-speech (TTS) engine (specific engine to be determined) that allows users to listen to the interpretations in a natural-sounding voice. This feature aims to create a more engaging and personalized interaction with the AI.
