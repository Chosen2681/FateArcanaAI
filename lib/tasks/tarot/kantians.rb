It focuses on the reliability, validity, and limitations of the knowledge generated and represented computationally. This differs from traditional philosophical epistemology by focusing on concrete computational mechanisms and observable behaviors rather than abstract philosophical arguments.",

Understanding the epistemology involves analyzing how these parameters represent features and relationships in the data.\n* **Recurrent Neural Networks:** Knowledge is represented in the hidden state, capturing temporal dependencies. Epistemological analysis here focuses on how the recurrent connections enable the network to learn sequential information. \n* **Bayesian Neural Networks:** These explicitly model uncertainty using probability distributions over the network parameters, providing a direct framework for epistemological analysis through posterior distributions.\n* **Knowledge Graphs:** These explicitly represent knowledge as a graph of entities and relationships, offering a clear, structured representation amenable to formal epistemological analysis.",

For example, let A be the set of possible actions an agent can take, and let P(a | S) be the probability of taking action a ∈ A given the agent's internal state S.  Free will could be characterized by a non-zero entropy in the distribution P(a | S), implying a degree of unpredictability beyond what could be determined solely from S.  Furthermore, the internal state S itself might evolve in a non-deterministic manner, incorporating noise or randomness, further contributing to the unpredictability of actions.",
    architecture: "From a computational neuroscience perspective, free will might be related to the complex interplay of neural networks in the brain.  Models such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs), particularly those with stochastic units or long short-term memory (LSTM) components, could provide a framework for simulating some aspects of decision-making that appear non-deterministic.  However, building a computational model capable of demonstrating genuine free will, as opposed to simply simulating randomness, remains a significant challenge.  Bayesian networks or other probabilistic graphical models could also be used to represent the probabilistic relationships between internal states and actions. This approach would allow for incorporating prior knowledge and beliefs in the decision-making process.",

  MORALITY = {
    definition: "Morality, from a computational perspective, can be defined as a set of rules or algorithms that govern the behavior of an artificial agent (e.g., a robot, a software program, or a virtual character) within a specific environment. These rules determine how the agent should act in various situations to achieve certain goals while adhering to ethical principles or social norms.  This definition emphasizes the procedural and deterministic aspects of morality, rather than its subjective or philosophical interpretations.  Different moral frameworks can be represented as different algorithms.",
    math: "A simplified representation might involve a function M: S -> A, where S is the set of possible states the agent can perceive, and A is the set of actions the agent can perform. The function M maps each state to an action considered morally acceptable according to a specific moral framework.  More complex representations may involve probabilistic models, reinforcement learning frameworks (with a reward function that reflects moral values), or multi-agent systems where morality influences interactions between agents.",
    architecture: "No specific neural network architecture is inherently tied to morality.  However, several architectures can be used to *implement* or *learn* moral decision-making: \n* **Reinforcement Learning (RL):**  An RL agent can learn a moral policy by interacting with an environment and receiving rewards based on its actions. The reward function is crucial and needs to encode the desired moral principles. \n* **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs):**  RNNs can be used to model the temporal aspects of moral decision-making, as moral judgments often depend on the history of interactions and events. \n* **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs):** GNNs can be used to model the relationships between different moral principles and their interactions.\n* **Hybrid Architectures:**  Combinations of these and other architectures can create sophisticated models of moral reasoning.",

  SUBJECTIVITY = {
    definition: "Subjectivity refers to the degree to which a piece of text expresses opinions, evaluations, or personal feelings, as opposed to objective facts.  Computationally, subjectivity detection involves classifying text as either subjective (expressing opinions) or objective (presenting facts). This is often a binary classification problem, but can be extended to a multi-class problem representing different degrees of subjectivity.",
    math: "Let x be a text document represented as a sequence of words or tokens: x = (w₁, w₂, ..., wₙ).  A subjectivity classifier aims to predict a label y ∈ {0, 1}, where y = 1 indicates subjective text and y = 0 indicates objective text.  The classifier can be represented as a function f: X → Y, where X is the space of text documents and Y = {0, 1}. The probability of a text being subjective can be expressed as P(y=1|x).",
    architecture: "Various neural network architectures can be employed for subjectivity detection.  These include:
      * **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), particularly Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU):**  These are suitable for capturing long-range dependencies within the text sequence.
      * **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):** These can effectively capture local patterns and n-grams within the text.
      * **Transformer Networks:**  These models, leveraging self-attention mechanisms, have demonstrated strong performance in natural language processing tasks, including sentiment analysis (closely related to subjectivity).  Models like BERT, RoBERTa, and XLNet can be fine-tuned for subjectivity detection.

This is often manifested in the emergent behavior of complex systems like deep neural networks.",
    math: "While there's no single equation defining computational intuition, its emergence can be partially analyzed through metrics like generalization performance (e.g., test accuracy, AUROC) and the model's capacity to extrapolate to unseen data points.

It can emerge in various architectures, including but not limited to: feedforward neural networks (FNNs), convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and graph neural networks (GNNs).
